- A fantastic resource for python: [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)
    - To get a good grip on Python, set aside 10 minutes every day and go through one concept.
        - Once a week, spend some extra time going over what you've learned and adding it to your knowledgebank.
    - Suggested order:
        1. the main tutorial topics (Intro, Getting Started, Syntax, Comments, ...), then
        2. the matplotlib section, then
        3. the Pandas Tutorial, then 
        4. the Machine Learning section, then
        5. the numpy tutorial.
- Susan Li's Collection of Python notebooks is a good resource for "boilerplate code" (code that can easily be modified to suit many needs)
    - [https://github.com/susanli2016](https://github.com/susanli2016)
    - The code is not overly well documented, but it has good structure. 
    - It's a good idea for you to start your own repositiory like this! Every time you learn something new, write up your own explainer (with toy data, if necessary) and make it available to everyone! This will also be useful if you ever have to teach Data Science topics in a course.

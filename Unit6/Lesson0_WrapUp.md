# Ciao, friends!

In the last few weeks we were really excited about having you all in this BootCamp! We are hoping that we were able to introduce you to the big world of data science! Here we present a summary of what we covered in the BootCamp.  
 

# BootCamp in nutshell: 
- In different fields of research we can implement machine learning methods as a powerful tool to understand our data better. 
- We can obtain data from different sources, wherever data come from it is important to realize there might be some missing/ messy data, there might be some data collection errors and biases. 
-  There are many different models, it is important to recognize where each model might be useful and where they won't be useful. 
-  We briefly talked about supervised and unsupervised learning as well as classification and regression tasks. 
-  Introduces Python as a data scientist tool. 
- Introduced different sources of data. 
- Data cleaning is an important part of data science, some examples of data cleaning is provided in Lesson 2 of this unit.
- Visualizing data can be really helpful! We introduced Matplotlib library within Python for this task! 
- Visualization can give us some insights about the performance of a model as well.  We alos showed some visualization methods to evaluate both regression and classification models. 
- Introduced pandas and matplotlib libraries in Python. 
- Talked about linear regression in details. 
- Understood that models are always going to have "errors", and that inspection of these errors will tell us more about our model and/or data.
- Discussed overfitting in the models and talked about some strategies about resolving it.
- Described some actual published research, using linear regression.
- Discussed short comings of the linear regression.
- Discussed bias and variance trade-off.
- Introduced logistic regression and saw an actual example of using it in a dataset .
- Introduced trees and their families!
- Talked about neural networks and showed a code example.
- Introduced natural language processing (NLP).


# Unit 6 in a nutshell:

- This Unit only has one main lesson in which we are introducing a pupular unsupervised learning algorithm.

In this Unit, we introduce neural networks and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each of these topics can be their own complete course. 
Thus, the purpose of this unit is to simply introduce the topics rather than diving deep into details. 

Lesson 1: Introduction to Neural Networks

Lesson 2: Hands-on coding with Keras API in Python for Neural Networks

Lesson 3: Introduction to NLP and text mining

Lesson 4: Hand on coding with Keras AP
